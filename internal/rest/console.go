// RestGetConsole serves the operator console.
//
// It is served from this service rather than from somewhere of its own so that
// the page and the API share an origin: the console calls the same endpoints an
// operator would call by hand, and a separate origin would have meant either a
// CORS policy on an API that has no authentication yet, or a second thing to
// deploy next to the first.
//
// The page is documented as not cacheable because it is the one file that
// changes whenever the API it draws does, and a stale console showing fields
// that no longer exist is harder to diagnose than a reload.
//
// @ID GetConsole
// @Summary Open the operator console
// @Description Serve the single page console that calls this service's own API
// @Tags [Console] Operator Console
// @Produce html
// @Success 200 {string} string "The console page"
// @Router /ui [get]
